# School_District_Analysis
## Overview of the school district analysis: 
The purpose of this analysis is to assist Maria and her supervisor to analyse the math and reading scores for Thomas High School due to suspicions of academic dishonesty. I have replaced the math and reading scores for Thomas High School to NaNs while keeping the rest of the data intact. A written report describing how these changes affected the overall analysis was also included.
## Results:
•	How is the district summary affected?

![district_summary_new](https://github.com/nyoung246/School_District_Analysis/blob/main/Resources/district_summary_new.PNG)

The first photo above shows us the results from the module and the second photo shows us the results from the updated analysis. The only difference shown here is that “Average Math Score” decreased by 0.1% in the updated analysis.

•	How is the school summary affected?

![school_summary_new](https://github.com/nyoung246/School_District_Analysis/blob/main/Resources/school_summary_new.PNG)

The first photo above shows us the results from the module and the second photo shows us the results from the updated analysis. The differences shown here is that the reading and math scores are lower in the updated analysis. This gives us the over passing percentage to be 0.318% lower than the old results from the module.

•	How does replacing the ninth graders’ math and reading scores affect Thomas High School’s performance relative to the other schools?

![9th_grade_math_new](https://github.com/nyoung246/School_District_Analysis/blob/main/Resources/9th_grade_math_new.PNG)

The first photo above shows us the results from the module and the second photo shows us the results from the updated analysis. In our updated analysis, Thomas High School’s math score shows “nan” compared to the 83.6% shown in the original result from the module. As the score shows “nan”, it is undefined and considered “0%”. Therefore, compared to the other schools Thomas High School’s 9th graders have performed poorly.

As for the reading results, the first photo above shows us the results from the module and the second photo shows us the results from the updated analysis. In our updated analysis, Thomas High School’s reading score shows “nan” compared to the 83.7% shown in the original result from the module. As the score shows “nan”, it is undefined and considered “0%”. Therefore, compared to the other schools Thomas High School’s 9th graders have performed poorly.

•	How does replacing the ninth-grade scores affect the following:

*  Math and reading scores by grade
When replacing the ninth-grade math and reading scores, it did not affect the other students from grade 10th to 12th. Also looking at the top 5 schools from the new analysis and the old analysis from the module, it seems Thomas High School has held their place as the top second school.
* Scores by school spending

![spending_new](https://github.com/nyoung246/School_District_Analysis/blob/main/Resources/spending_new.PNG)

Looking at the two photos above, when replace the ninth-grade math and reading scores, the “% Overall Passing” score by school spending for Thomas High School decreased by 0.32%.
* Scores by school size
![size_old](https://github.com/nyoung246/School_District_Analysis/blob/main/Resources/size_old.PNG)
![size_new](https://github.com/nyoung246/School_District_Analysis/blob/main/Resources/size_new.PNG)

As seen in the the two photos above, when replace the ninth-grade math and reading scores, the “% Overall Passing” score by school size for Thomas High School decreased by 0.32%.

* Scores by school type

When replacing the ninth-grade math and reading scores, there doesn’t seem to be a change in the “% Overall Passing” score by school type for Thomas High School.

## Summary:
Four changes that occurred when the ninth-grade reading and math scores were updated to NaNs are as follows:

•	Average math and reading scores

•	Overall passing percentages by school spending

•	Overall passing percentages by school size

•	The overall ninth-grades’ scores were affected
